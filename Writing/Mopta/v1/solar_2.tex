	\section{Introduction}
	
	We consider a problem where a solar photovoltaic power station (SPP) commits (e.g., on power auctions) to deliver $p_t$ MWh of energy at the hour $t$. Solar production is considered uncertain and represented with the random parameter $\tilde{s}_t$. The solar production is zero during some hours a day.
	Within the SPP, there is a bulk storage, e.g., pump hydro generator or Li-ion batteries, with a given storage capacity $ \overline{X}$. The bulk storage is used to meet the uncertainty of the solar generation in order to meet the contract commitments. Also, it can be used for selling/purchase energy in the pool-based market at price $\lambda_t^q$/$\lambda_t^p$ ($\lambda_t^p \ge \lambda_t^q$). The purchased/sold energy, $p_t$/$q_t$, from/to the pool-based market has to be decided a day-ahead of the energy delivery. Observe, that energy purchased $p_t$ from the pool-based market would make  possible to meet the contract for days with very little solar generation. 
	
	The following optimization model summarizes the above described problem. 

	\begin{subequations} \label{eqn: solar_1}
	\begin{eqnarray}
		\max_{x,y,z,p,q} && \sum_{t \in t} { \lambda_t^q q_t- \lambda^p_t p_t }     \label{eqn: solar_obj} \\
		\mbox{s.t.} &&    \PP \left\{ q_t  \geq s_t^{\omega} + z_t^\omega -  y_t^\omega,  \forall t\in T  \right\} \ge 1-\alpha  \label{eqn. commit} \\
		 && x_{t+1}^\omega = x_t^\omega +  \eta_c (y_t^\omega + p_t) - \frac{1}{\eta_d} (z_t^\omega + q_t),  \forall t \le |T|-1,  \omega \in \Omega       \label{eqn: solar_2}\\
		 &&	 \underline{X} \le x_t^\omega \le \overline{X},  \forall t \in T, \omega \in \Omega 	\label{eqn: solar_3}\\
		 &&   0 \le y_{t}^\omega   \le \overline{Y} (1-\alpha_t^\omega),      \forall t \le |T|-1, \omega \in \Omega  \label{eqn: solar_4} \\
		 &&	 0 \le z_{t}^\omega   \le \overline{Z} \alpha_t^\omega,     \forall t \le |T|-1, \omega \in \Omega  \label{eqn: solar_5} \\
		 && \alpha_t^\omega  \in \{0,1\}, \label{eqn: solar_6} \forall t \in T, \omega \in \Omega \\
		 && p_t, q_t  \ge 0. \label{eqn: solar_7} 
	\end{eqnarray}
	\end{subequations}

The objective function in~\eqref{eqn: solar_obj} aims to maximize profit; i.e., revenue from the sale
minus purchase cost. A more sophisticated model could include piecewise linear or quadratic costs; see, e.g.,~\cite{carrion2006};~\cite{wu2011tighter}. Constraint~\eqref{eqn: solar_1} requires that the
joint probability of meeting the promised energy to sell, by the available solar power via $s^\omega$, and the battery, via  $z^\omega$ and $y^\omega$,  for the entire horizon meets a threshold; e.g., $1-\varepsilon = 0.95$ or 0.99. Constraint~\eqref{eqn: solar_1} defines the energy stored in the battery at hour $t+1$ by the existing energy, via $x_t$, the charge, via $y_t + p_t$, and the discharge, via $z_t + q_t$ for the entire time horizon. Constraints~\eqref{eqn: solar_3}-\eqref{eqn: solar_6} enforce upper and lower bounds on the battery capacity, via $\underline{X}$ and $\overline{X}$, discharging limits, via $0$ and $\overline{Y}$, and the charging limits, via $0$ and $\overline{Z}$.  The binary nature of $\alpha$ ensures that at any hour the battery cannot be both charging and discharging. We note that for any hour it is possible for the battery to be neither charging nor discharging.  Constraint~\eqref{eqn: solar_7} ensures that the power purchased and sold is non-negative.
